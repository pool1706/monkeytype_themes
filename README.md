### HOW TO USE

#### Option 1 — Download the JSON and import manually
1. **Copy the jason file code** from the theme.jason file for the theme you wish to import
2. Open Monkeytype → **Settings → Danger zone → Import or export the settings as JSON → Import → then PASTE THE CODE**
3. The theme, including the background, will load automatically  

> Again, the background is already linked in the JSON. No extra download required.

### Notes & Tips
- Screenshots (`trail1.png`) are just for preview — optional.  
- Make sure the background image in the repo (`backgroud1.jpg`) stays in the same location. Renaming or deleting it will break the theme.  
- You can tweak font size, caret style, or other Monkeytype settings after importing.
