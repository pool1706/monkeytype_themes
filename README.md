### How to Use

#### Option 1 — Import via GitHub URL
1. Copy this URL:  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pool1706/monkeytype_themes/main/theme1.json
2. Open [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) → **Settings → Theme → Import**
3. Paste the URL and press **Import**
4. The theme will load, including the background image automatically  

> The background is already linked inside the JSON through GitHub, so you don’t need to download it separately.

---

#### Option 2 — Download the JSON and import manually
1. Download `theme1.json` from this repository.
2. Open Monkeytype → **Settings → Theme → Import → Choose File**
3. Select the JSON file
4. The theme, including the background, will load automatically  

> Again, the background is already linked in the JSON. No extra download required.

### Notes & Tips
- Screenshots (`trail1.png`) are just for preview — optional.  
- Make sure the background image in the repo (`backgroud1.jpg`) stays in the same location. Renaming or deleting it will break the theme.  
- You can tweak font size, caret style, or other Monkeytype settings after importing.
